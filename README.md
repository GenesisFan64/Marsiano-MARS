** Marsiano-MARS **

This is now being used to develop a new TECH DEMO for the 32X, If this project get popular enough this will become a GameBase/Library again.

- 68k is being used for the main logic

- Z80 handles the sound, including PWM (with the help of Slave SH2)

- MASTER SH2 controls the visuals (2D+3D), SLAVE SH2 does the PWM playback and sometimes it's used for dual-cpu tasks.


This is also being used to research bugs and limitations of the real hardware that current emulators ignore... see hwnotes.txt for details.

TODO: List of features.
