# Marsiano-MARS
A multi SEGA-system game codebase for Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Sega 32X, Sega CD32X and Sega Pico.

WORK IN PROGRESS, IN THE MIDDLE OF CLEANUP.

- Sega Genesis and Sega 32X roms are tested on real hardware.
- Sega CD, Sega CD32X and Sega Pico are UNTESTED as I don't have either Sega CD or the Sega Pico (There's no flashcarts for Pico anyway)

Prebuilt binaries are located in the /out folder for testing: ROMs are built separately between 2 types: For popular Emulators and for actual Real Hardware. (ares-emu can run those, still not 100% perfect at least on 32X)

Roms are for NTSC systems, SCD isos are for the USA region.

If the Genesis and 32X versions doesn't boot or it freezes: I probably broke something without testing on HW, FOR the other systems I can't guarantee if those will work on their respective hardware.
