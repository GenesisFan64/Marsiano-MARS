** Marsiano-MARS **

A GameBase/Engine/Library for making Sega 32X Games in assembly using all CPUs:

- 68k for the game logic

- Z80 for the sound including PWM

- SH2 for the 2D+3D visuals and extra sound channels.


This is also being used to research bugs and limitations of the real hardware that current emulators ignore, see hwnotes.txt for details.

(No list of features until everything gets working again.)
