# Marsiano-MARS
A multi SEGA-system game codebase for Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Sega 32X, Sega CD32X and Sega Pico.

WORK IN PROGRESS, IN THE MIDDLE OF CLEANUP.

- Sega Genesis and Sega 32X roms are tested on real hardware.
- Sega CD, Sega CD32X and Sega Pico are UNTESTED on hardware as I don't have a Sega CD or the Sega Pico (There's no flashcarts for Pico anyway)

Prebuilt binaries are located in the /out folder for testing, ROMs are for NTSC systems, SCD roms are for the USA region.

If the Genesis and 32X versions doesn't boot or it freezes: I probably broke something without testing on HW, other versions I have no clue if those will work.
